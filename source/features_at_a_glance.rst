Features at a Glance
********************************************************************************

After a first and simple sample session in :ref:`Section 2 <getting-started>`
we now want to give you a more detailed overview of the features of QGIS. Most 
features presented in the following chapters will be explained and described in 
own sections later in the manual.

Starting and Stopping QGIS
================================================================================

In :ref:`Section 2.3 <getting-started-sample-session>` you already learned how 
to start QGIS. We will repeat this here and you will see that QGIS also provides
further command line options.

* |nix| Assuming that QGIS is installed in the PATH, you can start QGIS by 
  typing: qgis at a command prompt or by double clicking on the QGIS application
  link (or shortcut) on the desktop or in the application menu.
* |win| Start QGIS using the Start menu or desktop shortcut, or double click on 
  a QGIS project file.
* |osx| Double click the icon in your Applications folder. If you need to start 
  QGIS in a shell, run /path-to-installation-executable/Contents/MacOS/Qgis.

To stop QGIS, click the menu options {|nix| |win| |osx|} Quit, or use the 
shortcut Ctrl+Q
